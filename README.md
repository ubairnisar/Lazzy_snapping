# Lazy Snapping Algorithm Results

## Overview
the following experiment contains the results of applying the Lazy Snapping algorithm to a set of images using kmean algorithm developed by me vs sklearn model.The Lazy Snapping algorithm is a popular image segmentation technique that allows users to efficiently and interactively segment images by providing input strokes to indicate foreground and background regions.
